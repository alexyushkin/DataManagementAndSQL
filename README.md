The streaming company StreamIt Ltd. offers movies, series and shows through the internet. 
It has agreements with content creators and owners and streams their content. Periodically (for example, monthly) StreamIt Ltd. pays content suppliers one time payment for the opportunity to stream certain content and royalty for the content which was purchased by its customers. To maintain business relationships with content providers StreamIt Ltd. collects information about them: name of the person or business, address, contact data, bank account data, which content they own. 
Customers of the StreamIt Ltd. are located all around the world. To see the content customers must first register. When register, they input their data like first and last name, day of birth, gender, country of living, and contact data as phone and email. 
Except the title, StreamIt Ltd. also collects data about content like type (movie/series/show), genre, year of release, duration, description, price for the customer, cost for the company, which helps customers to choose what to see as well as gives the company information about what amount to charge and what amount of royalty to pay.
When customer purchases the content, the company registers which customer purchased which content. This allows to charge customers, pay royalties as well as recommend those customers similar content for future views (with help a recommendation system which uses customers’ preferences).
Stream Ltd. also has a rating and review registration system which allows to use the second recommendation algorithm which uses sentiment analysis and ratings, so the company can advise customers which content has better ratings including that one which has good reviews from customers with similar interests.  
Took into account that some people (fans of actors) can watch content just to see their favorite actresses and actors playing, the company has created database of actors with some information about them and connected their records to the content they played in. 
For sure, StreamIt Ltd. has another databases, for example database of employees and database of expenses which are used for payroll and accounting purposes, but as soon as they are much less connected to the business model, we will leave them out of the scope of this assignment.
Using data stored in the future database, StreamIt Ltd. wants to have an opportunity to get the following reports:
- Revenue, Profit, Number of Streams, Number of Active Customers (customer engagement), Average Rating of All Content (customer satisfaction) by Country over certain period of time to measure overall success.
-  Revenue, Profit, Number of Streams, Number of Active Customers, Average Rating of All Content for a certain period of time month by month to understand trends.
- Number of new customers the company attracts month to month (customers acquisition).
- Growth rate of Streams and Active Customers month to month.
- Average Revenue, Profit and Views per Customer (unit economics to measure success in scaling as opposed to overall performance).
- Revenue by months of the year (seasonality) for better financial management.
- Content items with higher Revenue for better understanding the company’s audience preferences and resource planning (rights for which kind of content it makes sense to purchase in the future most).
- Content with Average Rating higher than the total average for more profitable pricing. 
- Statistics by genre: Average Rating, Number of Ratings, Number of Reviews, Number of Streams, Number of Content which has at least one rating. It will help management decide on which genre to allocate money most.
- Actors who played in most popular content items with views number greater than 5 sorted by rating. Similar with reports on genre and customers preferences regarding the content, such a report must help the company management in making decisions in rights for which content (with which actors playing) to invest in the future most.
